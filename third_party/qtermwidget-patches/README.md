# QTermWidget patches for Easy SSH

Applied on top of [lxqt/qtermwidget](https://github.com/lxqt/qtermwidget) tag `2.4.0`
by `.github/scripts/build-qtermwidget.sh`.

| Patch | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `0001-…` | Public `writeToEmulator` / `setEmulationSize` for PTY-less SSH teletype |
| `0002-…` | Windows build: stub KPty/Pty (no ConPTY), History/wcwidth fixes |

On Linux/macOS only the API from 0001 is required at runtime; 0002 is inert
(Unix sources remain selected by CMake).
